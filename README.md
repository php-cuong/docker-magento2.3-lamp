# How to install Magento 2.3 on localhost
How to install Magento 2.3 with Docker Compose on Windows 10 Pro. In the previous lesson, I showed everybody how to install Magento 2.2.x on Windows 10 Pro in the video link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akcaOBrLTzM&list=PL98CDCbI3TNvPczWSOnpaMoyxVISLVzYQ, today I show everybody installing Magento 2.3.

## The basic System Requirements:
    - Windows 10 64bit: Pro, Enterprise or Education (1607 Anniversary Update, Build 14393 or later). You can check Windows 10 Build Version on your computer by going to Run â†’ enter the "winver".
    - Virtualization is enabled in BIOS. Typically, virtualization is enabled by default. This is different from having Hyper-V enabled. For more detail see Virtualization must be enabled in Troubleshooting.
    https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/troubleshoot/#virtualization-must-be-enabled
    - At least 4GB of RAM.
    - Git is installed, go to the link for downloading https://git-scm.com/download/win
    - Docker Community Edition 17.06.2-ce-win27 is installed, go to the link for downloading https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/release-notes/#docker-community-edition-17062-ce-win27-2017-09-06

Okie, let's go.

Let's do this practice, you need to follow steps by step:

## Step 1: Install Docker CE 17.06.2 on the Windows 10 Pro 64bit
Go to the link https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/release-notes/#docker-community-edition-17062-ce-win27-2017-09-06 for downloading the docker CE 17.06.2

## Step 2: Create the docker containers from docker-compose.yml
    - Before creating the docker containers, you must share the local drives where you will save the source codes for your projects. Go to Docker -> Settings -> Shared Drivers, select the local drives you want to be available to your containers.
    - Move to the local drive that you are working on it, don't use the C drive, because all your data will be lost if you re-install windows.
    - Git clone https://github.com/php-cuong/docker-magento2.3-lamp.git
    - Open the docker-compose.yml file and change volumes following the path on your computer
    - Create the docker containers from docker-compose.yml file
    Run the command line: docker-compose up -d
    - Let's see the images on your computer
    Run the command line: docker images
    - Let's see the containers on your computer
    Run the command line: docker ps -a
